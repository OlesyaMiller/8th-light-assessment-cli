8th-light-assessment-cli
Welcome to my JavaScript CLI Google Books API search app!

My application lets the user search for their favorite books and save them to the reading list.

For the app to work first run 'npm install' command to install necessary packages.

To start the app simply type 'node index.js' in the terminal.

I hope you have the best experience with my product!
